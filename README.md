# About
Fantasy Football assigns points to real life football
players based on how they perform in game. Fantasy managers
form a virtual team and compete head to head to see whose team
can earn the most points each week. Machine Learning could be
used to predict player performance, giving an edge to fantasy
managers when selecting players. In this project, we develop and
evaluate multiple machine learning regression models to see
which one delivers the best predictions.

This repo includes 4 models:
1) Linear Regression (including ridge, elastic-net, and lasso)
2) Polynomial Regression
3) Support Vector Regression
4) Feed-Forward Neural Network

Offensive data from: Armchair Analysis https://www.armchairanalysis.com

Defensive data from: Stathead https://stathead.com/football/

# Quick Start
To run the different regression models on our processed running back data,
you have to run each machine learning model file individually (i.e. to view a linear regression model, type "python linear_regression.py" in command line)
